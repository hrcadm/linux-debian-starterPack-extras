# linux-debian-starterPack-extras

This Repository will contain common and not so common things to do and "remember" when using Linux Debian (stretch) distro.
Such as common issues (Wifi, Sources etc etc), common applications to install, configurations to modify, terminal commands & tips/tricks etc.

Used to use bookmarks for this things, but decided to add it to the Git repo and maybe help out other beginners and intermediate users.
Also, some things might be updated and I'll update the repo accordingly, while some are the same. So, this can be useful to check out upon fresh installation of the distro or in case you/I forgot about certain things.

Please do fork the repo and add what you might find useful to write down for later uses (or things you that you lost a bunch of time until you found the answer), but please follow the existing tree/file writing convention, for easier use.

Thanks
